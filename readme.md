## Introduction to the game
Welcome to my SPACEMAN game! SPACEMAN is a game where you will be presented with the length on a mystery word that will need to guess, one letter at a time. Each time a correct letter is guessed, it will fill in at it's corresponding location on the board. Each time an incorrect letter is guessed, one letter of "SPACEMAN" will appear. Your goal is to finish spelling your word before SPACEMAN is completely spelled out.

## Languages used
To create this game, I used a combination of 
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## Stretch goals
Here are some stretch goals I have as I continue to improve my game
- Choose from multiple different categories of words
- include an enter key so that letters aren't automatically inputted into the game
- have outlines for SPACEMAN to improve visibility of progress towards loss
- create more detailed space theming for background
- hide letters from keyboard upon use to help track progress of used letters
